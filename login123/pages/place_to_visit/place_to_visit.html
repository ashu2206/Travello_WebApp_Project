                    <p>“Travel isn’t always pretty. It isn’t always comfortable. Sometimes it hurts, it even breaks your heart. But that’s okay. The journey changes you; it should change you. It leaves marks on your memory, on your consciousness, on your heart, and on your body. You take something with you. Hopefully, you leave something good behind.”</p>

                      I had a guided tour and was very interesting to learn the historical facts1. The place is large, and I felt the setup is not very tourist friendly if you are an outsider. If you are a foreigner, make sure to carry good drinking water</p>
