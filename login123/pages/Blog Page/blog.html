                    <p> Kedarnath is a divine Hindu settlement situated in Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand.
                         It is one of the Char Dhams located in the Himalayas, and is situated at an astounding height
                          of 3584 meters above sea level near the head of Mandakini River.

                        The Kedarnath temple lies amidst the majestic snow-capped Garhwal Himalayan
                         ranges and is thronged by thousands of tourists and pilgrims each year.
                          Also, the Kedarnath trek is stunningly beautiful and quite eclectic,
                           even in the trekking circuit...</p>

                    <p> There’s a reason that Shimla is known as the Queen of Hill Stations,
                         and even if you were to take a glance at the most unremarkable photographs of the destination, 
                         you will know why. This evergreen beauty of Himachal Pradesh draws throngs of tourists year after year for its pleasant summers and snowy winters, 
                        thanks to its hilly terrain scented by pine and signature colonial era architecture.....</p>

                          you have seen the white marble structure a number of times in photographs and videos.
                            But
                         that does not in any way lessen the awe of visiting the
